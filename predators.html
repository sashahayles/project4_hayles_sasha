        <h2>Humans</h2>
      	<p>Today, the most urgent threat to elephants is large-scale poaching to supply the illegal ivory trade. Other threats facing elephants in Africa
            and Asia include conflict with humans and habitat loss and degradation.
            WWF advocates an end to commercial elephant ivory sales in the US and other major markets like China, Thailand and Hong Kong as the most effective and
            efficient solution to end this illegal ivory trade.</p>
          <p>
            In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in ivory. However,
            there are still some thriving but unregulated domestic ivory markets in a number of countries, which fuel an illegal international trade. Poaching to meet
            growing demand from affluent Asian countries is driving up the rate of poaching. In some countries, political unrest contributes to elephant poaching.</p>

      <h2>Animal Predators</h2>
    <p>  <p>Most people find it extremely interesting that elephants are classified as having no natural enemies. However, that doesn’t mean they are always safe out there
      in the wild. They can become prey to many animals including lions and tigers. This is mainly though if one of them is weak or very young. Since elephants form tight
      herds it is hard for predators to get them alone unless one falls behind the rest. For the most part elephants are very healthy so it isn’t often that one is able to become a meal for predators.
      Due to the many changes out there in the wild for many animals, there are some meat eaters that get brave from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>They will try to find slow moving young elephants when there is nothing
         else out there to eat. Since the herds of elephants don’t hide from meat eaters out there it can make them an attractive moving target. These predators do realize that adult elephants can kill them
         if they aren’t careful but if they are hungry enough they are going to take a chance. Since elephants do so spend so much time in the water, the young can become victims of crocodiles in the water.
         It isn’t very often that one will take the attempt to bring down a small elephant though. It seems that it is an unspoken law of the wild to not mess with elephants or their offspring.
