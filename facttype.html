				<p>How intelligent are elephants?
					Elephants are the world’s largest land mammals – and, aside from the great apes (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans) – the most intelligent.
					Elephants are the only remaining members of the Proboscidea order of mammals. The order included the extinct wooly mammoth and American mastodon.
					Elephants are a “keystone species.” If a keystone species disappears through extinction or removal, the entire ecosystem would change drastically. Other species rely on the keystone species for survival.</p>

				<p>Today there are three surviving elephant species:
				Asian elephant (Elephas Maximus)
				African savanna elephant (Loxodonta Africana)
				African forest elephant (Loxodonta Cyclotis)
				Among Asian elephants (Elephas Maximus), there are three subspecies: Indian, Sri Lankan, and Sumatran. These are distinguished by physical traits related to their geographic location. African savannah elephants
				(Loxodonta Africana) live in the grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. African forest elephant (Loxodonta Cyclotis) live in the Congo River Basin in western central Africa. Asian elephants live throughout southeastern Asia, from as far west as India to as far east as the Indonesian islands.

					<li>There are more than 100,000 muscle units in an elephant’s trunk, making it sensitive enough to pick up objects as small as a penny and strong enough to lift whole trees.</li>
					<li>An elephants trunk is the fusion of its upper lip and nose, and is incredibly versatile serving as a nose, an arm, a hand, a voice, and much more.</li>
					<li>Elephants favor either their left or right tusk, just as people favor one hand over the other. Tange is often seen carrying hay with her right tusk.</li>
					<li>Asian elephants are more closely related to the extinct wooly mammoth than they are to the African elephant.</li>
					<li>Baby elephants weigh approximately 200 pounds when born and the gestation period in elephants is almost two years.</li>
					<li>Elephants are highly social animals that form close bonds and family units. In the wild, family herds follow seasonal migration routes, led by a matriarch with decades of ecological knowledge about droughts, predation, and other threats.</li>
